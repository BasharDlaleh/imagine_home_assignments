**Project:** Imagine Weather App

**Objective:**
Build a weather forecast application that retrieves weather data from a public API and displays it in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The application should provide current weather information as well as a 5-day forecast for a selected location.

**Requirements:**

- Implement a search functionality that allows users to enter a location (city or zip code) and retrieve the weather forecast for that location.
- Display the current weather information, including temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and any other relevant details you consider important.
- Show a 5-day forecast, including the date, weather condition, and temperature for each day.
- Enhance the user interface with appropriate icons or images to represent different weather conditions (e.g., sun, clouds, rain).
- Allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature display.
- **Bonus:** Include an autocomplete feature in the search input to provide suggestions for locations as the user types.
- **Bonus:** Implement geolocation to automatically fetch and display the weather for the user's current location.

**Tools:**

- Utilize a public API.
- Employ modern frontend technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. You are free to use any frontend framework or library you prefer (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.).
- You may utilize an existing CSS framework or create your own custom styles.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Functionality: Does the application meet the specified requirements? Does it retrieve and display weather data accurately?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Does it follow best practices and utilize appropriate design patterns?
- User Interface: Is the user interface visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive across different devices?
- Performance: Is the application optimized for performance, considering factors like API requests, data caching, and rendering efficiency?
- Bonus Points: Have any of the bonus requirements or additional enhancements been implemented?
