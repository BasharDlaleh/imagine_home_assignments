**Project:** Imagine Movie App

**Objective:**
Develop a movie search application that utilizes a public API to fetch movie data and presents the results in a user-friendly and responsive interface. The application should enable users to search for movies by their titles and explore additional details for each movie.

**Requirements:**

- Implement a search feature that allows users to input a movie title and retrieve a list of movies that match the search query.
- Display the search results in a responsive user interface that adjusts to different screen sizes, employing appropriate CSS techniques such as media queries, flexbox, or grid.
- For each movie in the search results, present the movie title, poster image, release year, and any other relevant information you consider important.
- When a user clicks on a movie from the search results, display additional details about the selected movie, including the plot summary, director, actors, and IMDb rating.
- **Bonus:** If the API supports it, incorporate pagination or infinite scrolling for the search results.
- **Bonus:** Optimize performance and reduce API requests by implementing caching to store previously fetched movie data locally.
- **Bonus:** Integrate additional features or enhancements that you believe would enhance the application.

**Tools:**

- Utilize a public movie API, such as the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API (http://www.omdbapi.com/), or any other similar API of your choice.
- Employ modern frontend technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. You are free to use any frontend framework or library you prefer (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.).
- You may utilize an existing CSS framework or create your own custom styles.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Functionality: Does the application meet the specified requirements? Does it operate correctly without significant bugs?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Does it adhere to best practices?
- User Interface: Is the user interface intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing?
- Error Handling: Does the application gracefully handle errors and provide informative feedback to the user?
- Bonus Points: Have any of the bonus features or additional enhancements been implemented?
